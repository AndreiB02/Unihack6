🌍 Welcome to Neighbourly
Bringing Communities Together, One Shared Resource at a Time
Neighbourly is a community-focused app designed to help you connect with neighbors, share resources, and make a positive impact on your local environment. Instead of owning items you rarely use—like lawnmowers, tools, or grills—why not share them? Neighbourly makes it easy to save money, reduce waste, and create a sustainable community.

🛠 How It Works

Post Your Needs: Need something specific? Post requests and let the community come to your aid.
Plan & Attend Events: Organize or join local community events, from neighborhood clean-ups to skill-sharing workshops, block parties, and more!
It’s simple, fast, and a great way to get involved!
